•	hospital management system developed with Java’s Swing framework and Apache NetBeans 
•	Implemented separation of concerns to improve system architecture and maintainability
•	Developed a patient search function that allowed users to search for hospitals in a selected community within a selected city
•	Designed the system to allow each hospital to maintain a list of doctors who could CRUD (create, read, update, delete) patient data, including vital signs and encounter history
•	Created two admin roles with different levels of data access: one admin had full CRUD access, while the other could only CRUD community data
